# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

I wasn't able to get a working implementation for this lab, however, I see there's alot more work required for the staff's implementation as I learned how complexity can be divided into smaller sub classes so I must start thinking at the ground level before moving on to creating shapes and other tiles by creating classes that position each of these tiles as such in terms of both shape and location itself.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
Peanut to Peanut Butter would be the analogy. The hexagon is merely an object and the tesselation is how objects are ordered across a plane.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
First do the design document in order to know how your project is going to be structured and then focus on building classes sequentially for this project in order to reduce the complexity of the project.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is a path that can go only two directions where as a room has space where you can go in any direction in the room itself.
